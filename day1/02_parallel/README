Exercise 2

1) Compile "test.c" with the compiler (mpiicc) in the module intelmpi/2017--binary

2) Check with:
$ ldd <executable>
the list of required dynamic libraries.

3) Write "job.sh" (you can copy it from exercise 1), modifying the "select" line with the following requests:
#PBS -l select=2:ncpus=16:mpiprocs=16:mem=3gb
#PBS -l select=2:ncpus=16:mpiprocs=1:mem=3gb
Run first 32 processes and then 2 processes for each select.

Optional: if using Intelmpi (recommended), inside the job export the environment variable:
I_MPI_DEBUG=5
And see what information it prompts you on the standard error.
