Exercise 1

1) Write a job script with "walltime" of 3 minutes that asks for 1 node, 1 core and 128 GB of memory. Copy-paste the following in the execution section

hostname
echo 'Hello World'
sleep 4

Now add the automatic sending of the email in case of ending and abort of the job.

2) Launch the job with qsub

3) Check its state with qstat

4) The job should start almost immediately, so why isn't it starting? Check with "qstat -f <jobid>" and use the MARCONI UserGuide (see link in the last slide) to spot the error

5) Fix the script, delete the previous job with qdel and relaunch. 

6) Check its state again with "qstat -f jobid"  after having increased the sleep to 60, namely:

hostname
echo 'Hello World'
sleep 60
